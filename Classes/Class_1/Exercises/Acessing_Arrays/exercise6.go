// Create a program with a two-dimensional array that is at least 4Ã—4 (an array with at least four array values, where each nested array also includes at least four values). The completed program should display the following:

// The values of the main array, as well as the length of the main array
// The values in the second nested array, as well as the length of the second array
// The last value in the last nested array
